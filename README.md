# HTML5 Canvas Collision Game Prototype

HTML5 Collision Prototype

* HTML5 Boilerplate: [https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* Based on HTML5 Rocks "No Tears" Game: [http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/)

Working code for this is in main.js.
Note library dependencies.
I have no good reason for starting this with HTML Boilerplate but I did it anyway.
